## Topics

One of the methods that allows to simulate all this evolutionary machinery is the eponymous genetic algorithm: it starts with a bunch of random solution-candidates (a population), which are then improved using mutation and crossover, utilizing a fitness function to evaluate solutions (individuals) found so far:
