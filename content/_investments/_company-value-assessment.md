To evaluate a company's finances, there are three financial statements that you must carefully examine:

- Balance sheet
- Income statement
- Cash flow

The best place to start when evaluating a company is looking for liquidity on the balance sheet in cash form. Essentially, you're looking to see if the company has enough money to cover their expenses. You should also be checking to see if the company's short-term debts will cause them to exhaust their cash before the year's end.

To determine a company's liquidity on the balance sheet, you need to look for something called a current ratio, which is a measurement of the working capital that the company possesses. You can calculate the current ratio of a company, comparing its current assets that can be turned into cash and its current liabilities that must be paid in the upcoming year. Ideally, a company will have a 2:1 ratio of assets to liabilities.

Some companies can have a lower ratio if they are well run, meaning that they are effectively controlling your cash. Companies in slow-growth industries also may not need as much liquidity as companies in rapidly growing industries. Most companies, however, should have a 2:1 ratio.

## Check Income Statement

Need to check the `growth of earnings` and the `growth of net income`. 

Checking these metrics can help you to determine if the company is actually growing. Look at the bottom and top lines of the income statement going back 10 years. Do the numbers on the top line continue to grow over those 10 years? Preferably, the top and bottom growth lines will be parallel.

When these lines are parallel, it means that both the sales growth rate and the net earnings growth rate are rising at the same rate. If the lines are not parallel, it may mean that the company's earnings are growing while revenue is going down.

## Return on Assets

The next financial metric that you need to examine is the company's return on assets. There are three different measurements that you can check to determine what a company is accomplishing with its earnings compared to how much the company is spending to bring in those earnings:

- Return on assets
- Return on equity
- Return on capital

Companies worth investing in will have strong returns. Generally, a good company will have a 30 percent return annually. Examining a company's return on assets will reveal its profitability, as well as how effective the company is at using its assets to bring in revenue.

## Return on Invested Capital

The `ROIC` measures how efficiently the company is using its capital to produce profits. It is the single most important measure of whether a business is being run well, and it provides crucial guidance on whether you should consider investing in that company.

Because the `ROIC` will vary from company to company and from industry to industry, the `ROIC` is a
useful measure for comparing different companies to each other within an industry, and for comparing
entire industries to each other.

To determine a company’s `ROIC`, you’ll first have to locate its income statement. On the income statement look for `net profit` or `net profit margin` and `invested capital`.

```
The % ROIC = Net profit after taxes divided by the equity and the long-term debt
```

## Operating Cash Flow

The fourth and final factor that you should examine before investing in a company is `operating cash flow`, which you can find on the `cash flow statement`. Looking at this metric will help you to discover if the company is generating real cash. You need to determine exactly how the company is generating cash. Does the cash come from borrowing money and selling of stock and business assets? If so, then putting your money into this business is likely not a wise investment.

On the `cash flow statement`, you need to look for `operating cash flow`. Subtract the money that 
the company used to purchase equipment, known as `capital expenses`, from the operating cash flow.
What's left is the company's real `cash flow`. Basically, real cash flow is the money that can either 
be reinvested into the company or paid to the company's owner. This money is important, as it speaks 
to a company's ability to grow. You want to see real money coming in on the operating cash flow line.

Look at the balance sheet to find “current assets” and “current liabilities”. What you want to look for when evaluating a company is a `2:1` ratio of liquidity to debt or current assets to current liabilities.  

## Sales Growth Rate

The `Sales Growth Rate`, also called the `Revenue Growth Rate`, is pretty straightforward. It is 
the rate at which the total money earned by a company is growing (or not) year over year.



## Chief Executive Officer

At the helm of any publicly-traded company is the CEO. Confidence in this business professional can be a very telling sign of the future success of a company. Not only do CEOs help determine the strategic direction of a company, but they can also make or break the business with their decisions.

What to look for: A CEO should have a track record of savvy business moves on their resume. One of the quickest ways to learn more about a CEO is through their LinkedIn profile or the company “About Us” page.

Check out their career moves and details of how they helped their previous companies (and current company) grow. Ask yourself how their experience qualifies them to lead this company in the future.

If the CEO is the founder of the company, consider how the company would fare if they suddenly stepped down. Does the company have a bigger reputation than the CEO?

## Company Business Model

How a company makes money is referred to as its “business model.” While there isn’t a single way to run a business, successful companies should be positioning themselves to maximize profits.

What to look for: When researching a company’s business model, learn about its products and services, target market, and the industry it’s competing in.

Some companies (such as Amazon) are going after a wider audience with low prices and higher volume sales. Other companies (such as Apple) create exclusive devices that users gladly pay a premium for.

Many business models can be successful, but make sure you understand – and agree with – how the business is run before investing.

## Compare Debt-to-Equity Ratio

When researching company financials, take a look at the `debt-to-equity ratio` to see how well the company manages its total debt. To find the ratio, compare the total debt to the total equity shareholders have in the company.

For example: If a company has `$10,000,000` in debt and the total equity of all the shareholders is 
`$20,000,000`, it would have a `1:2` debt-to-equity ratio.

What to look for: Being over-leveraged can limit a company’s choices in making business decisions. 
A good rule of thumb is finding a company that has a `2:1` (or less) ratio, meaning that a company 
derives 66% or less of its funding from debt and 33% or more from shareholders.

The lower the debt ratio, the more a company can take risks without the worry of defaulting on its large debt load.

Note: Debt-to-equity ratios vary by industry, so be sure to research industry standard D/E ratios before judging whether a company is over-leveraged.

## Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The `price-to-earnings ratio` is a key indicator of whether a company’s stock is currently overpriced. 
To find the `P/E` ratio, compare the current stock price to the annual earnings-per-share (`EPS`). To calculate EPS, take the net profit and divide by total outstanding shares.

When evaluating any company, compare its `P/E` ratio to the current industry average. A higher `P/E` 
ratio may be a sign that the company is currently overvalued. A lower `P/E` ratio may be a sign that
the company is currently undervalued.
