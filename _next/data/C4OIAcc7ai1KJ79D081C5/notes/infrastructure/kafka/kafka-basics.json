Single <code>Kafka Cluster</code> is made of <code>brokers</code>.</li>\n  <li>\n    <code>Event</code> - is a message, which contains some information or simply alerts, that something happened.\n    Each event contains <code>key</code>, <code>value</code>, timestamp and some not mandatory metadata.\n  </li>\n  <li><code>Topic</code>  - stream or category to which event are published and organized.</li>\n  <li>\n    <code>Partition</code> - <code>topics</code> are divided into partitions, which may be spread across different <code>buckets</code>\n    on different brokers. Events with the same <code>key</code> will always be published to the same partition\n    ensuring with guarantee of event order in this partition.\n  </li>\n  <li><code>Producer</code> - application, which emits new events to Kafka instance.</li>\n  <li><code>Consumer</code> - application, which consumes and handles events from Kafka.</li>\n  <li><code>Consumer group</code> - group of consumers united by single <code>consumer id</code>. These consumers have same <code>offset</code>.</li>\n  <li><code>Offset</code> - number, used to persist current position in the topic or partition.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  To operate <code>Kafka</code> requires <code>Zookeeper</code> application, which allows <code>Kafka cluster</code> to track nodes status,\n  maintain list of topics and event messages.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Each <code>topic</code> may have many <code>producers</code> and many <code>consumers</code>. Topics may be replicated across multiple brokers.\n  Event are not deleted after consumer consumption.\n</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
